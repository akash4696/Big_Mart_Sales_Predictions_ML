# Big_Mart_Sales_Predictions_ML
## Sales Prediction Model - README

## Overview

This project predicts sales for different items at various outlet locations using machine learning techniques. The model has been implemented using XGBoost, and all necessary steps, from data preprocessing to prediction, are included in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Features

+ Uses XGBoost for sales prediction

+ Ensures negative sales values are replaced with zero

+ Takes input from a test dataset and outputs predictions in a structured CSV format

+ Supports feature engineering for improved accuracy

## Files in the Project

1. Sales_Prediction_With_Models.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow, from data loading to model training and evaluation.

2. xgb_predictions.csv: The raw predictions generated by the model.

3. xgb_predictions_updated.csv: The final predictions with negative sales values replaced by zero.

4. test.csv: The test dataset containing item and outlet details.

## How to Use

1. Run the Notebook: Open Sales_Prediction_With_Models.ipynb and execute all cells.

2. Ensure Correct Data Input: Make sure test.csv is available in the working directory.

3. Generate Predictions: The model will output predictions in xgb_predictions_updated.csv.

4. Validate Output: The final CSV should have three columns - Item_Identifier, Outlet_Identifier, and Item_Outlet_Sales.

## Model Details

+ Algorithm: XGBoost Regressor

+ Data Processing: Feature encoding, handling missing values, and one-hot encoding of categorical variables.

+ Performance Optimization: Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.

## Error Handling

+ If any sales predictions are negative, they are automatically replaced with 0.

+ Any missing values in input data are handled appropriately before training.

## Future Improvements

+ Experimenting with additional machine learning models for better accuracy.

+ Exploring deep learning approaches like neural networks.

+ Implementing a web interface for easy data input and visualization.
